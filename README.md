## General Info
This is a shitpost<br>
It was written by [Hugo Switt](https://github.com/bobgregory)<br>
It is hosted and owned by [That Guy Jack](https://github.com/that-guy-jack)
## The Origin
We were in a discord call looking for short domain names, when jack had the idea to make a max length domain. We spent a bit brainstorming names and trying to get one that was dead on the ICANN character limit and eventually settled on https://sowhydidibuyareallylongdomainjusttofindouthowlongadomaincouldbe.co.uk.
## Potential Improvements
This could potentially be improved by finding a longer TLD such as .international.
The background colour is quite bright, a more muted set of colours could make the site easier on the eyes.
